Intro
	This project displays four different sorting algorithms: Merge sort, Insertion sort, Quick sort, and Goldâ€™s Poresort. The algorithms will take a 15-character hexadecimal string and sort it from least to greatest. After each algorithm has sorted the string, it will take the starting string, take the last character and move it to the front. The program clears the webpage and starts over with the new string. The algorithms and webpage were all implemented in javascript.

Installation & Running
	1. Download the zip folder onto your computer. 
  2. Open the code folder. Either drag and drop the index.html file into your web browser or double click on the index.html file and it will open on the computers preset web browser.  
	
External Requirements
	There should be no external requirements that we are aware of at this time. The project should work with any web browser. 
	
	
Issues
	Some issues we came across when builiding
	1. After finding more resources and information, Gold's Poresort may not be completely finished.
	2. When going over the project, we realized we missed a step and had to revert back to a prior save file.
	3. Issues came across trying to get the ring implemented, the array would not cycle the last element. 
	4. Could not figure out what to display for the Quick sort algorithm. 
	5. Output was too large for insertion, ran out of time to fix.
