Intro
	This project displays four different sorting algorithms: Merge sort, Insertion sort, Quick sort, and Gold’s Poresort. The algorithms will take a 15-character hexadecimal string and sort it from least to greatest. After each algorithm has sorted the string, it will take the starting string, take the last character and move it to the front. The program clears the webpage and starts over with the new string. The algorithms and webpage were all implemented in javascript.
